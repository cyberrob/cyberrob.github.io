我相信這也是種學習的經驗，作為一位員工，分辨主管好壞，也是重要的存活技能之一。

所以，我想把對他的看法寫下來。

- A email-replying monkey assuming his spelling ability is so great.

- A clueless man:
  - mixed up requests/conclusions from one and the other.
  - Keep googling & ~~peer~~ pair-documenting-- with his beloved staff
  - explain his requirement with the first result of google search
  - love half-day long meeting and extend it to all-day meeting

- A bluffing man saying it will be get tough when we got a project running but there's never be a real project only assignment

- A two-faced man if you are considered not in his team in just a second

這樣的人討好上司沆瀣一氣的本事上有他的能力在，但我學不來。

學一次乖，也知道好好累積自己，不要輕易被薪水騙了！

以上。
