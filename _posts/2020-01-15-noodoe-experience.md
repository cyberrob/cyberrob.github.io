During my time working at Noodoe Inc. from 2016 to 2020, I was responsible for implementing app that could work with KYMCO dashboard through Bluetooth connection. In this post I'll briefly go through how I've done it and what challenges I've faced.

Through that connection we transfer commands, images and even navigation instructions onto dashboard. For all those data we implement a flexible editor to help user create speedmeter, weather widget, compass widget etc.

Lots of tests involving not only software team but also fireware, hardware team of 10 people to make sure entire experiences work as we expect it. This is also my first time experiencing test report from specialized QA personnel and code review which I REALLY learn a lot from it.

Another big achivement while working at Noodoe Inc. is implementing a custom view (like a mini multimedia player called journey view) that can playing a route on map and animating sets of images with selected music in the background. All of which are read from a well-defined json file generated by editor. Personally quite proud of delivering such a beautiful journey view to showcase our product goals.

The real challenge to implement this journey view is keep resources been used low but also efficient enough to get view ready for display and also purge those views removed. Ploting GPS coordinates onto GoogleMap to generate as X/Y coordinates is another challenge and fun thing to do. After hardwork, watching lines drawiing along X/Y coordinates calculated is very satisfying for me.
