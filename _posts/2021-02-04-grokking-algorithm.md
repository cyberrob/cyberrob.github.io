Since reading Grokking Algorithm, I find myself not fully perceive the idea of algorithm. Could it because of not familiar with programming language back when learning algorithm? Remember at that time the struggle of coding involing lots of configuration to make env works, not to mention sparing extra energy to figure out so-called algorithm!

That's why I love this book "Grokking Algorithm".
