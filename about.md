Hi there! Here is my personal blog trying to settled down on Github.
From Wretch/Pixnet to Blogger and to host a Ghost blog on Digital Ocean for about 2 yrs, I wrote less and less.

Then I realize it's about CONTENTS! not about fumbling formats or blog system.
Only contents leave behind after media or blog system went by one after one.

With enthusiasm for program development left I try to keep on writing life journals and my technical writings.

從無名/痞客邦，到 Blogger，又到 Digital Ocean 上架了個 Ghost Blog，似乎逐漸失去寫的能力，越寫越少！一路[流浪到~~淡水~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFJX3_xji2k) Github 暫居下來，帶著我對程式的些許熱情，加上免費 Hosting 又能用 Markdown 亂寫的份上繼續寫，希望能逐漸打造成像樣的家。

這裏除了程式開發的隨筆外，多是生活雜記。
