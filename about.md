This is my personal blog trying to settled down here on Github.
From Wretch/Pixnet to Blogger and to host a Ghost blog on Digital Ocean for about 2 yrs.
I wrote less and less.

Then I realize it's all about contents! not about formats or blog system.
Only contents leave behind after media or blog system went by one after one.

With enthusiasm for program development left I keep on writing.
Mostly life journals and some my technical writings.

這是個一路[流浪到~~淡水~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFJX3_xji2k)Github的部落格。
從無名/痞客邦，到Blogger，又到Digital Ocean上架了個Ghost Blog，我卻似乎失去寫的動力，越寫越少！

帶著我對程式的些許熱情繼續往前行，除了程式開發的隨筆外，多是生活雜記。
看在免費Hosting又能用Markdown亂寫的份上，期許自己能夠持續更新內容！
